- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hal5000
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about how to program and operate my 3D printer. Have taught myself how to program and operate an Anet A8 Plus that was given to me and loved it. Recently upgraded everything on it to SKR 2 with tft35 v3 and hope to expand my knowledge here along with learning how to troubleshoot better.
